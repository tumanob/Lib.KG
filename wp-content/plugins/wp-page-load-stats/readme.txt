Display memory, page load time, average load time and query count in the footer of your site.

== Description ==

Testing your WordPress site? This plugin allows you to display memory, page load time and query count in the footer of your site on both the front-end and within admin.

This plugin is partly based upon the WP Query Counter by Steven Word (http://www.stevenword.com/plugins/wp-query-counter/) and has been customised for my testing needs.
